Da REAL notes of interest:

- I'm either the world's worst programmer, or the amount of work expexted for this assignment is just too unreasonable.
Perhaps I aimed too high; I really was trying to make a sniper game, but I gave up half-way because I ran into so many
problems that I just didn't have the time to solve. So I backtracked and made a shitty joke game instead.

- I didn't actually ask David Hayter for voice acting.
